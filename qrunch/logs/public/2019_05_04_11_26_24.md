## Describe in your own words what you are building

```
The purpose of my application is to extract information from Twitter content and provide useful information.
For example, collect individual promotional information sent by the performers of a specific event and create a list of information about a specific event.
Aggregate content using filters and searches from users, timelines, lists, and favorites and extract target content by performing natural language processing, image analysis, visual inspection, etc.
I add a description to the list of extracted content (link or embedded form) and post it to my website (or blog).
```


## Will your product, service, or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity (or entity who serves government entities)?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
